# Title: SVG Logo Maker

## Description: 
This application generates and SVG logo based off user input. I used node js and inquirer and jest to get prompts from the command line, to allow user input, and also to test working code. I faced the challenges of how I wanted the SVG to be generated and where to on the page but it looks like we werent supposed to use an html structure or css so I left as is for now I would implement those in the future for making the logo a bit more appealing and presented on the live browser better. 
## How to Install and Run the Project:
Clone the github repository, have node js installed or install it from the command line,npm install inquirer @8.2.4,also install jest with npm install jest. Run the test by using npm run test in the terminal once navigated to the directory. Run the SVG generator by typing in node index and give user input.
